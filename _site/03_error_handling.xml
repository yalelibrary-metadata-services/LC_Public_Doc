<p>Several types of errors are monitored:</p>
<p><strong>HTTP Status Errors:</strong> URLs returning non-2xx HTTP codes (e.g., 400, 404) are flagged.</p>
<p><strong>Connection and Timeout Errors:</strong> Failures during the HTTP request or Selenium page load trigger error capture.</p>
<p><strong>Selenium-Specific Errors:</strong> If the document does not reach a “complete” state within a specified timeout, a READY_STATE_TIMEOUT_ERROR is raised.</p>
<p>Each error, along with contextual data (e.g., page source when available), is recorded. This granular logging is useful for troubleshooting and for determining whether the error is a transient network hiccup or a persistent issue needing manual remediation.</p>
