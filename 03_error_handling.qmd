Several types of errors are monitored:

**HTTP Status Errors:**
URLs returning non-2xx HTTP codes (e.g., 400, 404) are flagged.

**Connection and Timeout Errors:**
Failures during the HTTP request or Selenium page load trigger error capture.

**Selenium-Specific Errors:**
If the document does not reach a “complete” state within a specified timeout, a READY_STATE_TIMEOUT_ERROR is raised.

Each error, along with contextual data (e.g., page source when available), is recorded. This granular logging is useful for troubleshooting and for determining whether the error is a transient network hiccup or a persistent issue needing manual remediation.
