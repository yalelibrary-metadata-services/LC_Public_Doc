This report summarizes the results of the automated link checker designed to verify the health of URLs associated with catalog records. The report is intended for both management and unit-specific analysis. It details:

- Working vs. Non-working Links: A breakdown of URLs that are functional versus those that encounter errors.

- Data Aggregation: Totals and aggregated counts of errors by unit and by domain.

- Visualizations: Graphs showing distributions of errors, detailed tables, and bar charts for quick insight.

This documentation explains the underlying code processes, the database design (using Voyager data structures), and error capture mechanisms, along with recommendations for librarian interpretation and follow-up.
